## Overview

**Servus.Core** was born out of frustration - the kind every developer knows when you find yourself writing the same helper methods over and over again. This library is a collection of those "I wish this was built into .NET" utilities that somehow always end up missing from your toolkit.

Whether it's string manipulation that actually makes sense, date handling that doesn't make you cry, or collection operations that just work the way you expect them to - Servus.Core has you covered. It's the Swiss Army knife for .NET developers who are tired of reinventing the wheel.

## Why Servus.Core?

- **Born from Real Projects**: Every utility comes from actual production use cases, not theoretical scenarios
- **No more Copy-Paste Programming**: Stop copying helper methods between projects
- **Just Works**: Simple utilities that do exactly what you expect without surprises
